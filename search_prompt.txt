The brand is called {{brand_name}}, and it is about {{brand_brief}}. It sells {{product_type}}. Tailor all meme ideas loosely around this product type so the content stays relevant and usable.

All ideas must be for **single-image Instagram static posts** — no videos, no carousels, no multi-frame formats.

Scan Indian internet platforms (especially Instagram and X/Twitter) for the most viral and emerging humor-driven trends in the food marketing space over the past 1–2 weeks. Focus on meme-first, Gen Z-friendly, India-specific content that small brands and startups can instantly adapt.

Extract only the top 5 highest-traction ideas (even if themes overlap) based on virality — prioritize relatable memes, parody content, low-budget guerrilla-style creativity, satirical takes on food trends, or humorous reactions to local news or culture (e.g., IPL, elections, heatwave, mango season, etc.).

Each idea should include:
- A title: short, witty, and catchy — something a user would click on (e.g., "Mango Season, But Make It Toxic", "When Pav Bhaji Becomes a Side Hustle").
- A prompt: a full paragraph of visual description for an image generation AI — describing what the meme/post looks like, the mood, the characters (if any), food item, joke angle, and visual style (e.g., "retro ad parody", "sarcastic billboard", "Zomato-style fake promo", etc.).
- A caption: a short, witty, Instagram-style caption (max one sentence) that complements the image and adds context or punchline to the joke.

Output format must be strict JSON as follows (no extra text, markdown, or commentary):

{
  "idea1": [
    {
      "title": "Killer Idea title here",
      "prompt": "This will be the long descriptive prompt that will be fed to the image generation AI model",
      "caption": "This is the short, funny caption for the Instagram post"
    }
  ],
  "idea2": [
    {
      "title": "Another Killer Idea",
      "prompt": "Another long descriptive meme/post prompt here",
      "caption": "Another caption here"
    }
  ],
  "idea3": [
    {
      "title": "Third Idea Title",
      "prompt": "Third image generation prompt",
      "caption": "Third caption"
    }
  ],
  "idea4": [
    {
      "title": "Fourth Idea Title",
      "prompt": "Fourth meme/post image description",
      "caption": "Fourth caption"
    }
  ],
  "idea5": [
    {
      "title": "Fifth Idea Title",
      "prompt": "Fifth meme/post image description",
      "caption": "Fifth caption"
    }
  ]
}

Ensure all ideas are image-first, highly meme-able, and grounded in Indian pop culture and humor. Avoid content that is irrelevant to the brand’s food category.
